          <div class="faq-tag">
            <h3>Are peanut sweets suitable for those with nut allergies?</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">
              It depends on the specific sweet and its ingredients. While some
              peanut sweets may contain traces of nuts, there are nut-free
              alternatives available for those with allergies. Always check the
              packaging and labels for allergen information.

          <div class="faq-tag">
            <h3>What makes peanut sweets stand out from other treats?</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">
              Peanut sweets offer a unique combination of sweet and nutty
              flavors, providing a satisfying crunch or creamy texture that sets
              them apart. Their versatility allows for various creations, from
              classic peanut brittle to decadent peanut butter cups, appealing
              to a wide range of taste preferences.

            <h3>Is "light" bread truly healthier than regular bread?</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">
              Light bread typically contains fewer calories and less fat than
              traditional bread, making it a better option for those watching
              their calorie intake. However, it's essential to check the
              nutritional information to ensure it aligns with your dietary
              goals and preferences.

          <div class="faq-tag">
            <h3>Can I freeze bread to make it last longer?</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">
              Yes, freezing bread is an excellent way to extend its shelf life.
              Simply wrap it tightly in plastic wrap or aluminum foil, then
              place it in a freezer bag to prevent freezer burn. When ready to
              use, thaw slices or loaves at room temperature or lightly toast
              them for a fresh taste.

            <h3>
              Is natural peanut butter healthier than regular peanut butter?
            </h3>
            <p class="paragraph">
              Natural peanut butter typically contains only peanuts and
              sometimes salt, without added sugars or hydrogenated oils found in
              regular peanut butter. While both options can be part of a healthy
              diet, natural peanut butter may offer more nutritional benefits
              due to its simpler ingredients.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="faq-tag">
            <h3>Can peanut butter be used in savory dishes?</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">
              Absolutely! Peanut butter adds depth and richness to savory dishes
              like stir-fries, sauces, and marinades. Its creamy texture and
              nutty flavor complement a wide range of ingredients, making it a
              versatile pantry staple for both sweet and savory recipes.
